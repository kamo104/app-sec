What are you even doing, why are you hard coding validation logic in the front end instead of using the field-validator.        
  ┃  Why are you hard coding strings. This is unacceptable.

It's not only the issue with /posts/new. You did that all across the codebase. Fix it up. This is utterly unacceptable. WTF      ┃  are you doing. This code in unmaintainable. NO HARD CODED USER FACING STRINGS. Is that so hard to follow a single coding         ┃  instruction?
