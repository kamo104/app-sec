\section{Building and Running}

\subsection{Build Process}

The project uses \texttt{build.sh} to orchestrate the entire build process:

\begin{verbatim}
# Full build (WASM, backend, OpenAPI client, frontend)
./build.sh

# Development mode with hot reload
./dev.sh
\end{verbatim}

The build script handles:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
  \item WASM module compilation (\texttt{field-validator}, \texttt{translator})
  \item Backend build with OpenAPI generation
  \item TypeScript client generation from OpenAPI spec
  \item Frontend build
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Development Mode}

In development mode:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
  \item Swagger UI available at \texttt{http://localhost:4000/api/docs}
  \item Emails sent to MailHog at \texttt{http://localhost:8025}
  \item Database is unencrypted (\texttt{data\_dev.db})
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Production Mode}

In production mode:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
  \item Database encrypted with SQLCipher (\texttt{data.db})
  \item OpenAPI endpoints disabled
  \item HTTPS required for all traffic
\end{itemize}
