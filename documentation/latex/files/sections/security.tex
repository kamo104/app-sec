% Security Features Summary - Implemented measures and future enhancements
\section{Security Features Summary}

\subsection{Implemented Security Measures}

\subsubsection*{Password Hashing}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
  \item Argon2 is used for password hashing.
  \item Parameters tuned for modern hardware to resist brute force.
  \item Passwords are never stored or logged in plaintext.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Token Security}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
  \item Verification tokens are random, high-entropy values.
  \item Only token hashes are stored in the database.
  \item Tokens are single-use and time-limited.
  \item Tokens are not predictable and cannot be derived from user data.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Input Validation and Normalization}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
  \item Backend validates all fields regardless of frontend checks.
  \item Email is normalized (e.g., lowercased).
  \item Usernames are restricted to safe characters and reasonable lengths.
  \item Passwords must meet minimum length and complexity requirements.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Error Handling and Enumeration Resistance}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
  \item Error responses are generic: no difference between invalid credentials and unverified accounts, for example.
  \item Registration responses do not reveal if an email or username already exists.
  \item Detailed errors are logged server-side only.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Transport Security}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
  \item HTTPS enforced in production to protect credentials and tokens in transit.
  \item No sensitive data is transmitted unencrypted over the network.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Database Security}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
  \item Prepared statements are used (via SQLx) to prevent SQL injection.
  \item Separate database credentials for environments.
  \item Password and token hashes are not reversible.
  \item Access to the database is limited to the backend service.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Replay and Abuse Protection}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
  \item Tokens can be used only once and are marked as consumed.
  \item Expired tokens are rejected.
  \item Future enhancements include rate limiting and CAPTCHA.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Security Enhancements}

Planned or potential enhancements:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
  \item Rate limiting on registration and verification endpoints.
  \item CAPTCHA integration for bot and script mitigation.
  \item Production email service integration (SMTP or API-based).
  \item Scheduled cleanup of expired and consumed tokens.
  \item Session management using JWT or secure server-side sessions.
  \item Optional two-factor or multi-factor authentication.
  \item Password reset flow with secure tokens.
  \item Account lockout or step-up verification after repeated failures.
\end{itemize}
