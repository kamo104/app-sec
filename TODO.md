Prepare draft documentation describing your planned registration module. The document must include:
- full details of the student group, course, and exercise,
- a short description of the component (its purpose, what data it collects, security assumptions),
- component requirements (functional and non-functional),
- component architecture (simple diagrams, technology stack),
- database structure (tables, fields, constraints),
- UML sequence diagrams for registration and activation (including validations and alternative paths)
